  <p> <span> <strong>The Tomb of Yishai and Ruth </strong> is the ancient site that marks the burial locations of the father and great-grandmother of King David. Some archaeologists believe the site may be connected to King David who established Israel's first capital in Hebron.
<br/>
The Book of Ruth begins with the story of Naomi, a Jewish woman who travels with her family to Moab to escape a famine. After the death of her husband and sons, she decides to return to the Land of Israel. Her daughter-in-law Ruth, a Moabite, rather then let Naomi leave alone, chooses to follow her and join the Jewish people.
<br/>
Ruth is considered the paradigm of "hesed" or kindness and a template for convertion to Judaism. In chapter 1 verse 16, of the Book of Ruth, she speaks the famous phrase, "wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people and your God, my God." She later marries Boaz, and gives birth to Obed, father of Jesse, father of David.

For generations people have visited the site known as the Tomb of Ruth and Jesse, located in the Admot Ishai / Tel Hebron neighborhood of Hebron. At the top of a hill overlooking a vineyard, the old stone building today houses a small synagogue, prayer room and an alcove with stone artifacts that have yet to be thoroughly excavated. The roof provides a panoramic view of the Old City.
<br/>
Rabbinic tradition describes Jesse as one of four righteous men who died free of sin and one of the ten who entered the Garden of Eden during their lifetimes. This could be an allusion to Jesse's burial in Hebron as the Cave of Machpela is described as an entrance to the Garden of Eden.
<br/>
Ever since the Middle Ages, Jewish travelers have sought out this site as a holy place. Legends speak of a tunnel that links the Tomb of Jesse with the Tomb of Machpela. The authenticity of the site has been attested to by Rabbi Isaac Luria -- the Holy ARI.
<br/>
An ancient structure to the west of the west of the tel [hill], facing Jerusalem, has been identified as a synagogue. As of 2016, furnature and electricity have been installed in the cave-like structure and Jewish prayer services are held.
<br/>
On the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, it is traditional to read the Book of Ruth and many follow the custom of ascending to the Tomb of Ruth and Jesse for this purpose. A 2010 Jerusalem Post article entitled Converts Pay Homage to Ruth at Her Hebron Tomb states,
<br/>
"Thousands visit the tomb annually, particularly around Shavuot. On the afternoon of the festival, hundreds of people from the area visit the site, which has a garden and a small sanctuary where people study and pray."
