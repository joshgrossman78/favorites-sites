  <p> <span> <strong> The Cave of Machpela- </strong> has an ancient history dating back to the earliest man and woman in the Bible.  Adam and Eve are said to be buried in the cave, the first of four couples to be buried there. The Cave of Machpela and the field around it were Abraham’s first acquisition in the Land that God promised to him and his descendants.  Besides Adam and Eve, the three patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish people – Abraham and Sarah, Rebekah and Isaac, and Jacob and Leah – are buried there as well. These three holy couples gave birth to the Jewish people and brought the awareness of God to the world.  Since Biblical times, the Cave of Machpela has been a place of prayer, meditation, and study.  The cave is respected as a gateway to the Garden of Eden, where our prayers have a special potency. Hebron was the capital of the tribe of Judah. King David began his kingship here.  From Hebron, he was crowned King of Judah seven years before he was crowned king of Israel in Jerusalem.

The word “machpela” means “doubled.”  There are multiple interpretations for what this refers to. The Talmud (Eruvin 53a) cites two main opinions:
1.	Doubled refers to the layout of the cave, which consists of a cave on top of a cave.
2.	Just as Kiryat Arba, “the town of the four,” refers to the four couples who are buried in the cave, so too, machpela is a reference to these four “doubles” – Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah.
<br/>
Alternately, machpela could be a reference to the reward of those buried there: ”Whoever is interred there has multiple rewards” (Midrash Breishit Rabah 58).
Another meaning for Machpela is “folded”.  The Zohar explains that Jerusalem and the entire Land of Israel was folded under the Cave of Machpela.

Abraham bought the “cave at the edge of the field” for 400 silver shekels. Even though God told Abraham that this was his land as an inheritance and the Hittites offered to give him the cave for free, Abraham wisely insisted on pay full price for it, to insure that there would no question of ownership over this land and perhaps with prophetic insight into the future when others would try to claim it.
His purchase is also used as the source for establishing the four different methods by which land can be legally acquired in Jewish law – by money, by deed, by witnesses, and by physical possession.  The Bible records that Abraham used all four methods to acquire the Cave of Machpela and field surrounding it, establishing him and his descendants – Yitzchak, Yaakov, and the Jewish people – as its rightful owners for all time to come.
