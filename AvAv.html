  <p> <span> <strong> Avraham Avinu- </strong>The synagogue is mentioned by Rabbi Naftali Hertz Bachrach in his 1648 book Emek HaMelech. The book deals with the kabbalah, but in the introduction, he mentions a dramatic story about the Avraham Avinu synagogue.
Jordan took control of the area in 1948, and after this time a wholesale market, trash dump and public toilet were placed on the site of the Jewish Quarter. The ruins of the synagogue were turned into a goat and donkey pen. The adjacent, "Kabbalists' Courtyard" was turned into an abattoir.

<br/>
<br/>In 1971 the Israeli Government approved the rebuilding of the synagogue, courtyard and adjoining buildings.[8] Work on the restoration was underway in 1976.
<br/>
<br/>
The man instrumental in re-discovering and rebuilding the synagogue was local Hebron resident Ben Zion Tavger. He was a prominent physicist in the Soviet Union at Gorky University noted for his work in the Magnetic Symmetry phenomenon. He moved to Israel in 1972 and became a chair at Tel Aviv University. Tavger wrote in his book My Hebron about the Avraham Avinu synagogue: "I let my eyes wander around the interior of the synagogue. I had time to think and recall its previous state, five or six years ago, and thought of the sequence of events that had transpired. When I first came here, the place had indeed gone by the name of "Avraham Avinu Synagogue", but its name had seemed completely disconnected from its essence... To me it had seemed obvious that we had to dig and clear out the refuse and rubbish from the site, to reveal the splendor of the synagogue for all to see."
Today, the rebuilt synagogue is used each Friday night by the Jewish residents of Hebron to hold prayer services. The synagogue is also open to visitors each day of the week so they can learn about the history of the synagogue, and hold private services.
Today, a plaque with the cover of the book Emek HaMelech and the full text in the original printing hangs on a plaque on the wall of the rebuilt Avraham Avinu synagogue.

When Jews returned to Hebron following the 1967 Six Day War, the ancient synagogue was gone. A sheep sty and public bathroom occupied the place where the shul had stood for over 400 years.

<br/>
Due to the dedication and determination of one man, the late Professor BenTzion Tavgar the area was eventually cleaned out and the synagogue rebuilt.
<br/>
<br/>
This year, as every year, Yom Kippur prayers will be heard from this beautiful holy place.
<br/>
<br/>
Prof. Tavgar, prior to his death, wrote a book called My Hebron which was published a few years ago in Hebrew. It was recently translated into English and is now available. The following paragraphs, dealing with the rededication of the Shul and its ancient Torah scrolls, are from the book.

While I was in the synagogue, waiting for the Torah scroll to be brought in, I looked around once again at the walls of the building. The synagogue was now splendidly built, more or less approximating its original form, before it was destroyed in the 1950s. There might have been a few minimal changes here or there, and perhaps not everything had been completed and it was still necessary to fix something or other, but on the whole, the synagogue now looked beautiful, it appeared splendid. One could even say that it was impressive, though not very modern.

I let my eyes wander around the interior of the synagogue. I had time to think and recall its previous state, five or six years ago, and thought of the sequence of events that had transpired. When I first came here, the place had indeed gone by the name of “Avraham Avinu Synagogue”, but its name had seemed completely disconnected from its essence. Nothing about it had indicated that it was a synagogue. It had been used as a goat shed. On its eastern side there had been a familiar, or rather, a notorious structure – the public latrine – which had been erected for the use of those who frequented the adjacent wholesale market, and the rest of the site was used as a garbage dump.
 <br/>
This place, where previously there had been a goat shed, which had symbolized our disgrace and humiliation, was magnificently renovated and the ancient synagogue was at its center. We can pray in it! This is not something insignificant! It is a great thing, but it is not the conclusive thing, at least not from my point of view. When I had begun to dig here I had not set a goal for myself only to renovate the synagogue and not even the entire Jewish Quarter. My aim had been to change the atmosphere that had enabled the entrenchment of a state of affairs wherein on the site where a synagogue had once been standing in full glory, suddenly three “magnificent” establishments are standing: a goat-shed, a public toilet facility and a garbage dump. According to documents, the functioning of the goat shed within the synagogue had been approved by the Israeli authorities. Someone had signed the leasing contract with the Arab who was using the structure to house his goats. Someone had signed and others had agreed to it, or had turned a blind eye, while on the other hand, there were Jews whose soul had desired to clean the synagogue, to prepare it and restore its original function, and to turn it once again into a place of prayer.
 <br/>
In any case, I felt very festive during the ceremony and was completely overcome by joy.
