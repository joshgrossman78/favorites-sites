  <p> <span><strong> <em> <text-align: center;> The Realization of a Vision</em></strong><br/></p>
  <p> <span> <strong> Beit HaShalom- </strong>which was originally constructed as a shopping mall for Hebron’s Arab population- sits prominently on the central thoroughfare connecting between the neighborhood of Kiryat Arba and Ma'arat HaMachpela (the Cave of the Patriarchs) itself.
While there are currently a few families inhabiting the building under difficult conditions, plans are underway to immediately begin construction and transform the building into apartments for 17 families. Being able to transform the area in this way would constitute creating an entirely new Jewish neighborhood in Hebron, strategically placed as a vital connection of continuity with the Kiryat Arba neighborhood, and situated only five minutes away from Ma’arat HaMachpelah!
We cannot thank you enough for your interest in possibly purchasing an apartment in Beit HaShalom. In order to begin renovations as soon as possible, we need visionaries, such as yourself, who recognize the critical strategic importance of creating an entirely new neighborhood in Hebron -- an opportunity that has not presented itself in decades. The renovation and re-population of these buildings are now in their first, most preliminary, stages and you can have the incredible merit of helping to guarantee that this happens!
In doing so, you will be answering the call of Calev Ben Yefuna -one of the original 12 spies sent to Israel in the times of Moses- who made the following pledge 3000 years ago from Hebron:
<br/>
‘ עלה נעלה וירשנו אותה כי יכול נוכל לה. '
<br/>
The prices below are still not final. Some small changes may occur.<br/>
The prices vary depending on size, what floor it’s on, what directions<br/>
 it faces, and if there is a Mirpesset on it.
<br/>
<br/>
For a 70 sq. meter apartment – 989,000 shekel
<br/>
For a 120 sq.meter apartment – 1,778,000 shekel
<br/>
For a 167 sq.meter apartment – 2,713,000 shekel
<br/>
We look forward to hearing from you.
